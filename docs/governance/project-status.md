# Project Master Status

Permanent project governance document (Stage 4G, Part A). The persistent
master map of the platform's state — completed stages, active stage,
blocked stages, open decisions, known risks, external dependencies, and
production blockers. Updated at the end of every stage by the Master
Orchestrator. This is a summary/index — full detail always lives in
`docs/progress.md` (per-stage narrative), `docs/active-stage.md` (current
stage detail), and the ADRs cited below.

## Completed stages

| Stage | Title | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Governance + architecture foundation | Complete |
| 1 | Platform-API foundation (config, DB, auth skeleton, RBAC skeleton) | Complete |
| Security Hardening (pre-Stage-3) | Sessions RLS hardening, MFA/production-signing ADRs | Complete |
| 2 | Identity + tenancy + security (players, staff, sessions, audit) | Complete |
| 3A | Financial architecture freeze + payment provider agnosticism | Complete |
| 3B | Core financial infrastructure (wallet, ledger, payments, withdrawal) | Complete |
| 3C | Financial hardening & operational controls | Complete |
| 3D | Withdrawal governance final gate | Complete |
| 4A | Casino integration foundation | Complete |
| 4D-RG | Responsible Gaming player-status enforcement foundation | Complete |
| 4E | Person resolution & cross-brand identity foundation | Complete |
| 4F | Player verification, documents & authentication foundation | Complete |
| 4G | Orchestration governance + Risk & Limits engine foundation | Complete (this stage) |

## Active stage

Stage 4G — see `docs/active-stage.md` for full detail.

## Blocked stages

- **Bonus Engine**: explicitly blocked (Stage 4G §32) until the Risk &
  Limits architecture is stable enough for Bonus to consume without
  building its own independent limit engine. Not started.
- **Sportsbook**: not started — no directive has authorized it yet.
- **Real KYC/AML vendor integration**: not started — Stage 4F built the
  provider-neutral boundary only; no vendor is contracted.
- **Real casino provider integration**: not started — `MockCasinoProvider`
  only exists today.

## Open decisions requiring human/product/legal input

1. Should an approved KYC verification ever apply platform-wide to a
   Person (cross-tenant reuse)? (ADR 0028 §3/§7)
2. Should a future real KYC verification supply `VerifiedAttributes` to
   `internal/identityresolution.PersonResolver`, closing the cross-brand
   evasion gap? (ADR 0027 §7, ADR 0028 §7)
3. Should a bring-your-own-licence tenant be able to opt out of
   platform-wide Person resolution for data-controller/legal reasons?
   (ADR 0027)
4. Priority/timeline for contracting a real KYC/identity-verification
   vendor — the single highest-leverage open item, named by every stage
   since 4E.
5. Should a `RiskDecision` of `REVIEW` ever proceed provisionally pending
   a compliance workflow, or must it always block until one exists? This
   stage's `internal/casino` integration blocks on `REVIEW` exactly like
   `DENY` (see ADR 0031 §6) — a deliberate, disclosed simplification, not
   a resolved product decision.
6. What is the platform's target precedence when a HARD_LIMIT and a more
   specific CONFIGURABLE_LIMIT genuinely conflict in a real jurisdiction
   (e.g. a jurisdiction's legal maximum stake vs. a brand's own more
   generous commercial limit)? This stage's answer (HARD_LIMIT always
   wins, never overridden by a more specific configurable rule) is an
   architectural default, not a legal opinion — see ADR 0031 §5.

## Known P0/P1/P2 risks (carried forward, not silently closed)

- Stage 3D withdrawal TOCTOU (submit/resolve eligibility window).
- Payments-side unguarded-reversal race.
- Casino per-tenant provider signing-key design (not yet built).
- Casino real-provider API documentation requirement (no real vendor
  contracted yet).
- Cross-brand real-player protection remains inactive for a real player
  (Stage 4E's own limitation, unchanged by 4F/4G).
- RG future controls not implemented (deposit/loss/wagering/session
  limits at the RG layer specifically, reality checks, time-outs/
  cooling-off) — NOTE: Stage 4G's Risk & Limits engine can express a
  deposit/session/stake THRESHOLD, but does not implement RG's own
  player-protective controls (self-exclusion remains `internal/rg`'s
  sole domain) — see ADR 0031 §1 for why these stay separate domains.
- Bonus Engine accounting decisions not yet made.
- Sportsbook provider documentation not yet available (no vendor).
- The intermittent `TestConcurrent_DuplicateBetDeliveryDuringSelfExclusion`
  flake (Stage 4D-RG/4E) — unrelated to Risk & Limits, not fixed by this
  stage.
- Stage 4G's own P2s — see `docs/progress.md`'s Stage 4G entry for the
  full itemized list.

## External dependencies / provider documentation requirements

- Real KYC/AML vendor (Onfido or equivalent) — not selected.
- Real casino game aggregator — not selected.
- Real PSP(s) for production payment rails — not selected.
- Real crypto custody provider (ADR 0008) — not selected.
- Sportsbook feed/widget provider — not selected.

## Human decisions required before production launch

- Gambling licence decisions and jurisdiction selection beyond Anjouan
  (per CLAUDE.md's "When to stop and ask").
- Vendor/provider contracts for every "External dependency" above.
- Production credentials and commercial pricing for any contracted
  vendor.
- Legal interpretation of jurisdiction-specific RG/KYC/AML requirements
  before any real-money go-live.
- Explicit authorization for each future stage per the stage-gate rule.

## Production blockers (summary)

Every item in "Blocked stages" and "External dependencies" above is a
production blocker. The platform today (post-4G) has: identity/auth,
wallet/ledger, a mock casino provider, RG self-exclusion foundation,
person-resolution foundation, KYC/document-management foundation
(mock vendor), and a Risk & Limits foundation (no real provider/vendor
integration anywhere) — a real-money launch requires resolving every
"External dependency" and every numbered "Open decision" above first.
