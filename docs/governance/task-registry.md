# Task Registry

Permanent project governance document (Stage 4G, Part A). Persists task
state across Claude sessions — the repository, not any conversation, is
authoritative. Updated by the Master Orchestrator as work progresses;
each stage's own directive supplies the task list, this registry is
where it is tracked to completion.

Columns: **ID** · **Stage** · **Owner** · **Status** · **Dependencies** ·
**Files owned** · **Interfaces affected** · **Tests** · **Docs** ·
**Blockers** · **Integration status**

## Stage 4G

| ID | Owner | Status | Dependencies | Files owned | Interfaces affected | Tests | Docs | Blockers | Integration |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 4G-01 | Orchestrator | Done | none | `docs/governance/*`, `.claude/agents/risk.md` | none | n/a (documentation) | this registry + siblings | none | n/a |
| 4G-02 | risk (Orchestrator-implemented) | Done | 4G-01 (roles must exist first) | `migrations/0041_*`, `internal/risk/*` | New `risk.Evaluate(ctx, tx, RiskRequest) (RiskDecision, error)` boundary | `internal/risk/*_test.go` (unit + integration + concurrency) | `docs/decisions/0031` | none | Integrated into casino (4G-03) |
| 4G-03 | casino (Orchestrator-implemented) | Done | 4G-02 | `internal/casino/orchestrator.go` (risk-evaluation call sites only) | Consumes `risk.Evaluate` at `LaunchGame`/`postBet` | `internal/casino/risk_enforcement_integration_test.go` | `docs/architecture/08-casino-integration-architecture.md` | none | Integrated |
| 4G-04 | 9-area parallel review (architect, ledger-finance, casino, identity-compliance, security x2, backend, qa, architect) | Done | 4G-02, 4G-03 | n/a (review only) | n/a | n/a | Findings folded into `docs/progress.md`/`docs/decisions/0031.md` Stage 4G entries | none | n/a |
| 4G-05 | Orchestrator | Done | 4G-02, 4G-03, 4G-04 | `docs/progress.md`, `docs/active-stage.md` | none | full validation gate | this stage's completion report | none | n/a |

## How to use this registry (for future stages)

1. At stage start, the Orchestrator breaks the directive into tasks and
   adds rows here with `Status: Not started`.
2. As work proceeds, `Status` moves through `In progress` → `Blocked`
   (with a reason in **Blockers**) → `Done`.
3. A dependency request filed per `integration-protocol.md` is recorded
   as a note on the requesting task's row (in **Blockers** until
   resolved, then moved to **Dependencies** once satisfied).
4. **Integration status** is only set to `Integrated` by the Orchestrator,
   never by the implementing specialist itself — mirrors
   `integration-protocol.md`'s "nothing is assumed integrated until the
   Orchestrator says so" rule.
5. This table is never deleted across stages — completed stages' rows
   remain as the historical record; a new stage adds a new `## Stage NN`
   section below the most recent one.
